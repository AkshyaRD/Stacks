# Perfroming opeartions on Stacks

### About Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.
In a stack, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint. 
The behavior of a stack is described as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO). 
When an element is “pushed” onto the stack, it becomes the first item that will be “popped” out of the stack.

### About the code

**Global Variables**

A variable top is initiazed to -1
A variable data is created 

**Inside the main**

A do while loop is created which allows us to perform the operations on the stack in a loop.

**Push**: This Function
