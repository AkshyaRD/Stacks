# Performing opeartions on Stacks

### About Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.
In a stack, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint. 
The behavior of a stack is described as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO). 
When an element is “pushed” onto the stack, it becomes the first item that will be “popped” out of the stack.

### About the code  
3 separate functions have been declared to perform the push, pop operations and to display the elements of the Stack  

#### Variables Used  
**Global Variables**  
"int stk[10]" array of int type and size=10 to store elements of the stack  
"int top" to store the topmost element of the stack  
"int data" to input data entered and store it in the stack  

**Inside the main**  
"int choice" to store the choice of the user

**Inside function void display()** 
"int i" for running iteration on the for loop  

#### Functions  
1. void push(int data)  
To push the data entered into the stack  
If Stack is full the program gives a message "Stack Overflow" 
Otherwise it adds the element to the top of the Stack.  

2. void pop()  
If the value of top=-1, that is, if the stack is empty the program gives a message "Stack Underflow"
Otherwise it pops the element from the stack  

3. void display()  
If the value of top=-1, that is, if the stack is empty the program gives a message "Stack is Empty"  
Otherwise displays the elemnts present in stack from top to bottom
